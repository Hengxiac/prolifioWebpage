            I am currently a cs master student majoring in game development. Having learnt 3D
            graphics, game engine architecture, I know the basic mathematics we frequently use
            and rendering pipeline in game development.

            I have been coding in C++ since I was a freshman in university. And I also know about
            C, C#, Python, lua, javascript, go, etc.

            I am a beginner in Unreal and currently working on 2 game projects based on unreal. I
            also have projects based on Unity.

            I have some experience about web and mobile development as well as linux.

            The area that interest me most are the graphics and shader part. I like to reproduce
            the photorealistic world in game. I am studying hard to gain more knowledge about them.
